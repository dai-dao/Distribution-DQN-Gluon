My implementation of Distribution DDQN, inspired by DeepMind's papers.

Unfortunately I coudln't get the algorithm to learn at all, don't really know why. Guess there's really 
a huge difference between a working version of an algorithm implemented in Tensorflow, and attempts 
to implement the same code using a different framework.

Nonetheless, I'm moving on to other projects for now. Perhaps time will help me figure out what's really wrong with my code.
